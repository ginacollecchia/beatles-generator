A Streamlit app for generating new Beatles chord progressions

# About
Using data sourced from Christopher Harte's 2010 PhD thesis, I built an app to generate new chord sequences using first-order Markov Chains. 
You can modify the length of the output sequence, as well as choose to segment it by song parts (verse, chorus, etc.) and generate individual
chord sequences per section.
